WordPress is a very special project to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create something beautiful that I&#8217;m proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours have gone into WordPress, and we&#8217;re dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right\">&#8212; Matt Mullenweg</p>\n\n<h1>Installation: Famous 5-minute install</h1>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.</li>\n\t<li>Open <span class=\"file\"><a href=\"wp-admin/install.php\">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a <code>wp-config.php</code> file with your database connection details.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>If for some reason this doesn&#8217;t work, don&#8217;t worry. It doesn&#8217;t work on all web hosts. Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code> and upload it.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Open <span class=\"file\"><a href=\"wp-admin/install.php\">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser.</li>\n\t\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <code>wp-config.php</code> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\" title=\"WordPress support\">support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather.</li>\n\t<li><strong>If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you.</strong> If you did not provide a username, it will be <code>admin</code>.</li>\n\t<li>The installer should then send you to the <a href=\"wp-login.php\">login page</a>. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on &#8220;Profile&#8221; to change the password.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>Updating</h1>\n<h2>Using the Automatic Updater</h2>\n<p>If you are updating from version 2.7 or higher, you can use the automatic updater:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Open <span class=\"file\"><a href=\"wp-admin/update-core.php\">wp-admin/update-core.php</a></span> in your browser and follow the instructions.</li>\n\t<li>You wanted more, perhaps?
