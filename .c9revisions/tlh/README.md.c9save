{"ts":1380920037869,"silentsave":true,"restoring":false,"patch":[[{"diffs":[[1,"Wordpress on OpenShift\n======================\n\nThis git repository helps you get up and running quickly w/ a Wordpress installation\non OpenShift.  The backend database is MySQL and the database name is the \nsame as your application name (using getenv('OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME')).  You can name\nyour application whatever you want.  However, the name of the database will always\nmatch the application so you might have to update .openshift/action_hooks/build.\n\n\nRunning on OpenShift\n----------------------------\n\nCreate an account at http://openshift.redhat.com/ and install the client tools (run 'rhc setup' first)\n\nCreate a php-5.3 application (you can call your application whatever you want)\n\n    rhc app create wordpress php-5 mysql-5 --from-code=https://github.com/openshift/wordpress-example\n\nThat's it, you can now checkout your application at:\n\n    http://wordpress-$yournamespace.rhcloud.com\n    \nYou'll be prompted to set an admin password and name your WordPress site the first time you visit this \npage.  \n\nNote: When you upload plugins and themes, they'll get put into your OpenShift data directory\non the gear ($OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR).  If you'd like to check these into source control, download the \nplugins and themes directories and then check them directly into php/wp-content/themes, php/wp-content/plugins.\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nGIT_ROOT/.openshift/action_hooks/deploy:\n    This script is executed with every 'git push'.  Feel free to modify this script\n    to learn how to use it to your advantage.  By default, this script will create\n    the database tables that this example uses.\n\n    If you need to modify the schema, you could create a file \n    GIT_ROOT/.openshift/action_hooks/alter.sql and then use\n    GIT_ROOT/.openshift/action_hooks/deploy to execute that script (make sure to\n    back up your application + database w/ 'rhc app snapshot save' first :) )\n\nSecurity Considerations\n-----------------------\nConsult the WordPress documentation for best practices regarding securing your wordpress installation.  OpenShift \nautomatically generates unique secret keys for your deployment into wp-config.php, but you may feel more\ncomfortable following the WordPress documentation directly.\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2200}]],"length":2200}
